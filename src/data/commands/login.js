      description:`Log interactively into an environment, such as a Salesforce org.

Logging into an environment authorizes the CLI to run other commands that connect to that environment, such as deploying or retrieving metadata to and from an org.

The command first prompts you to choose an environment from a list of available ones. It then opens a browser to the appropriate login URL, such as https://login.salesforce.com for an org. Then, depending on the environment you choose, the command prompts for other actions, such as giving the environment an alias or setting it as your default.

This command is fully interactive and has no flags other than displaying the command-line help. Each environment has its own specific login command, such as "sf login org", which usually provide more flags than this interactive one. For more information about the interactive prompts from this command, see the help for the environment-specific command, such as "sf login org --help".`,

Opens a Salesforce instance URL in a web browser so you can enter your credentials and log in to your org. After you log in, you can close the browser window.

Logging into an org authorizes the CLI to run other commands that connect to that org, such as deploying or retrieving a project. You can log into many types of orgs, such as sandboxes, Dev Hubs, Env Hubs, production orgs, and scratch orgs.

We recommend that you set an alias when you log into an org. Aliases make it easy to later reference this org when running commands that require it. If you don't set an alias, you use the username that you specified when you logged in to the org. If you run multiple commands that reference the same org, consider setting the org as your default.

Use --set-default for your default scratch org or sandbox, or --set-default-dev-hub for your default Dev Hub.

By default, this command uses the global out-of-the-box connected app in your org. If you need more security or control, such as setting the refresh token timeout or specifying IP ranges, create your own connected app using a digital certificate. Make note of the consumer key (also called cliend id) that's generated for you. Then specify the consumer key with the --clientid flag.`,

Use this command in automated environments where you can't interactively log in with a browser, such as in CI/CD scripts.

Logging into an org authorizes the CLI to run other commands that connect to that org, such as deploying or retrieving a project. You can log into many types of orgs, such as sandboxes, Dev Hubs, Env Hubs, production orgs, and scratch orgs.

Complete these steps before you run this command:

1. Create a digital certificate (also called digital signature) and the private key to sign the certificate. You can use your own key and certificate issued by a certification authority. Or use OpenSSL to create a key and a self-signed digital certificate.

2. Store the private key in a file on your computer. When you run this command, you set the --keyfile flag to this file.

3. Create a custom connected app in your org using the digital certificate. Make note of the consumer key (also called client id) that's generated for you. Be sure the username of the user logging in is approved to use the connected app. When you run this command, you set the --clientid flag to the consumer key.
